Create your own contest on COJ

As you know if you have a account on COJ, you cannot make your own contests easily. To do so you have to contact the admins of the site. That can become a really huge disadvantage if your planning to practice and to make competitions on the site.

This is why COJAcademic was developed, to help you making easier to create contest that are updated in real time. This is done thanks to the new COJ's API.

## How to start

First, you neead a web server running PHP and MySQL. Once you have that you just need to clone the project or download it. Run the script for the DB, and put the folder on your server.

Then you need to change the values for the config file to match your server's credentials.

Now you are ready to start creating your own contest.
